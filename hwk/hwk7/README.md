# Alexander Durbin (ajd2@vt.edu) Final Project Repository

This repository contains the solutions to the presentation homework
assignments. It contains subdirectories for the source code for each problem
separated by presentation, ie, `gpu` has the output and source
code for the `gpu` assignment. The top of this directory contains `hwk7.Rmd`,
this is the written solution to this assignment which will call/source files
from these subdirectories as needed.
