# Homework 3 Repository
This respository contains three files. `hwk3_sol.Rmd` contains the solutions and when sourced will source `hockey.R` for Problem 4. `nhlstandings.sh` is a shell script that will also execute `hockey.R`. I am aware that `.csv` files should not be included in the repositories, however the Dow Jones Industrial Average downloaded from Yahoo! Finance is specific to my solutions. It contains all the information through 1985.
