# Problem 4

- R CMD BATCH
    - Called with `R CMD BATCH [options] input_file output_file args`
    - By default produces a `.Rout` file with same name as `input_file`.
    - `.Rout` contains the input and output of running the commands in `input_file` in the `R` console.
    - Plots specified in `input_file` are placed in `Rplots.pdf` on separate pages.
